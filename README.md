# Ecommerce-Simulation-Dataset
This project is dedicated to generating a high-fidelity simulated dataset for an ecommerce platform specializing in computers and video games. The dataset aims to mirror real-world transactional data, providing a robust foundation for analytics, machine learning models, and data architecture simulation.

## Overview
The dataset encompasses a variety of features, including:

Transactional data for computer and video game purchases
Customer interaction data with various touchpoints (organic, paid, and influencer-driven)
Simulated financials, such as pricing, commissions, and revenue
Geographic distribution of sales across major cities
Multiple payment method scenarios
Order statuses reflecting a realistic customer journey
This data is invaluable for:

Data analysts and scientists looking to practice data wrangling, exploration, and visualization
Data engineers who need to architect data pipelines and storage solutions
Machine learning practitioners requiring transactional data for predictive modeling
Ecommerce strategists analyzing market trends and consumer behavior


## Features
- *`Data Generation Scripts`*: Automated scripts to generate fresh, customizable datasets.
- *`Notebooks`*: Jupyter notebooks that document the data generation process, including data exploration and preliminary analysis.
- *`Tests`*: A suite of tests to ensure data integrity and consistency.
- *`Data Samples`*: Sample datasets for quick testing and reference.

## Usage
Whether you're looking to test out a new data analysis tool, benchmark database performance, or simulate data pipelines in a cloud environment, Ecommerce-Simulation-Dataset provides you with the starting point. You can scale the data volume as per your requirements, from a few hundred to millions of records.

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas on how to enhance the dataset, optimize the generation process, or extend the data model, please feel free to fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
